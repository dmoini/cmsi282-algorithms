# CMSI 282: Algorithms
Selected programs from CMSI 282: Algorithms course at Loyola Marymount University

- **DominoSolver**: Given arguments that specify a valid sequence of dominoes, it outputs the maximum possible reward for reducing the sequence to a single domino.
- **SchoolgirlSolver**: Returns a solution to Kirkman's schoolgirl problem (done in collaboration with [Ian Lizarda](https://github.com/ianlizzo)).
- **DiceSolver**: Returns the probability of winning a dice game where rolling one six gives you a win and rolling zero sixes gives you a loss, using randomized estimation.
- **PowersAndPolynomials**: Contains several problems involving:
    - Raising x to the power n, for some arbitrary values of x and n.
    - Polynomial evaluation using Horner's Rule.
    - Finding greatest common divisors using Euclid's algorithm.
    - Finding least common multiples using the technique discussed at class.
- **SquareRootFinder**: Returns the square root of x with specified precision given by epsilon.
